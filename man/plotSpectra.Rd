\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \linkS4class{MizerSim} or
\linkS4class{MizerParams}.}

\item{species}{The species to be selected. Optional. By default all target
species are selected. A vector of species names, or a
numeric vector with the species indices, or a logical vector indicating for
each species whether it is to be selected (TRUE) or not.}

\item{resources}{The resources to be selected. Optional. By default all
resources are selected. A vector of resource names, or a numeric vector
with the resource indices, or a logical vector indicating for each resource
whether it is to be selected (TRUE) or not.}

\item{wlim}{A numeric vector of length two providing lower and upper limits
for the w axis. Use NA to refer to the existing minimum or maximum.}

\item{ylim}{A numeric vector of length two providing lower and upper limits
for the y axis. Use NA to refer to the existing minimum or maximum. Any
values below 1e-20 are always cut off.}

\item{power}{The abundance is plotted as the number density times the weight
raised to \code{power}. The default \code{power = 1} gives the biomass
density, whereas \code{power = 2} gives the biomass density with respect
to logarithmic size bins.}

\item{total}{A boolean value that determines whether the total over all
species and resources in the system is plotted as well. Note that even if
the plot only shows a selection of species, the total is including all
species. Default is FALSE.}

\item{background}{A boolean value that determines whether background species
are included. Ignored if the model does not contain background species.
Default is TRUE.}

\item{highlight}{Name or vector of names of the species to be highlighted.}

\item{return_data}{A boolean value that determines whether the formatted data
used for the plot is returned instead of the plot itself. Default value is FALSE}

\item{...}{Other arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object, unless \code{return_data = TRUE}, in which case a data
frame with the four variables 'w', 'value', 'Species', 'Legend' is
returned.
}
\description{
Plots the number density multiplied by a power of the weight, with the power
specified by the \code{power} argument.
}
\details{
When called with a \linkS4class{MizerSim} object, the abundance is averaged
over the specified time range (a single value for the time range can be used
to plot a single time step). When called with a \linkS4class{MizerParams}
object the initial abundance is plotted.
